I have managed to achieve 1,2,3,4 and have not managed to achieve the full effect of 5 but have managed to have the Zumo beep when it has detected an object in it's path.
I have not done 6 or 7.

Some code I have used for the Arduino part are from examples Line proximity and line and proximity sensors. To test to see how to do it in my own code to ensure it works.

The GUI code is my own after getting Python working on my laptop.
